Just want to double check. because the automated findings say dont use encodPpacked. Anything we find related to hash collisions would be invlaid correct?

Let me expand a bit. Simply saying "encodePacked should not be used" is not good enough, but "here is how I can cause hash collision that allows to steal tokens" is high value report, no matter if the fix is to remove `encodePacked`

[03/11/2023 15:34] dontonka
basic question: YUL vs SOL file. 
- Which compiler compile YUL files and in which VM are those contract executed (ETH or ZK)? Why writing in YUL save gas compare to SOL?
- All the SOL files are compiled with the same compiler, and run on which VM ?


[03/11/2023 15:35] vladbochok
All contracts are supposed to be run on zkEVM, even more it is kinda a part of zkSync Era protocol. That's why we called them "system contracts".  The zkEVM Solidity compiler is used.

When we write the contracts on pure yul, we may manage the memory layout on our own. So, no free memory pointer, and all arithmetics that we do may be much more optimized.

[03/11/2023 19:51] vladbochok (pinned)
We are using a different Solidity compilers that compile into zkEVM bytecode (it is different from EVM). The foundry uses the standard compiler, so that's a reason for failure. Please use the default script instead

what would be the best way to test specific System Contract that doesn't seems to be tested when we run simple test 🤔 ? For example, I would like to test further the logic of **BytecodeCompressor**, how would you suggest todo that efficiently, or there are actually some test that trigger this code already?


[03/11/2023 23:56] dontonka
Which system contract are actually tested during a test, beside the obvious **ContractDeployer** ?


[03/12/2023 00:23] vladbochok
I don't think there is a tests for this in era-compiler-tester, but you could run your own test if you want. Just follow the instruction from the doc - https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync#add-a-new-test

{Reactions}

[03/12/2023 00:33] vladbochok
Many of them. A simple example is keccak256/sha256/ecrecover, they are called whenever Solidity code calls the corresponding precompile. 

Others:
- Event writer is called whenever an event is emitted. 
- SystemContext is called when the block.timestamp/block.number, etc are called in Solidity code.
- MsgValueSimulator/L2EthToken when the msg.value is present in the call.
- ImmutableSimulator on deploys (deployer calls it) and when the contract get the immutable variable
- KnownCodesStorage on deploys.
- AccountCodeStorage on deploys and every time user call the contract (it derives what code will be executed).
- Empty contract on call to zero address.

And others

bootloader and some system contracts are analog consensus layers for state transition rule. Ethereum does many jobs besides the EVM execution, validating transactions (checking signatures, verify and updating nonce), taking fees, etc. Besides that, Ethereum implements precompile separate from EVM. All of this is done as system contracts.
- NonceHolder - manage account nonces
- KnownCodeStorage - specifies which bytecodes can be deployed
- DefaultAccount (of custom account if a user wants to) - manage the transaction validation rule, etc.

Some contracts are more like a way to mimic EVM behavior (to support Solidity codebase without changes) or L2-specific system feature:
- L2EthToken/MsgValueSimulator - brings `msg.value` into zkEVM, since it isn't in the VM specification
- BytecodeCompressor - contracts that help to publish fewer data onchain by compressing it on L2
- ImmutableSimulator - brings the `Immutable` Solidity feature, since the way contracts are deployed on L2 is different from L1 (the L2 deployment is much cheaper by design)
- L1Messenger - helps to send an arbitrary amount of bytes to L1

That being said, precompile is a part of system contracts too. We have 3 precompiles - sha256/ecrecover/keccak256. Please note, keccak256 is a precompile in our architecture, not an opcode as it has been done in the EVM.

A general question, will all contracts be deployed on zkSync only? are there contracts that will be deployed on L1? 
I appreciate some insights on this. still trying to understand the concept (high level)

.

[03/12/2023 11:09] vladbochok
These contracts are supposed to be predeployed to the zkSync network. It is only an L2 contract and shouldn't be deployed anywhere else. 

For the basic concept, I can recommend reading the docs from the previous contest. https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-10-zksync-v2-contest

e.g. what L1 contract is meant by here?

Is it any L1 contract? or a specific one?


[03/12/2023 11:14] vladbochok
It is a specific L1 contract that we have audited in the previous c4 (and tier 1 audit companies to be exact)

It seems like the link on the contest page is wrong, it redirects to the same c4 page:                  Bootloader
Bootloader is the program that accepts an array of transactions and executes the entire zkSync block. The introduction to why it's needed can be found here.    <-- There is a like on here, but redirects to c4 again


[03/12/2023 12:53] vladbochok

[03/12/2023 13:06] supernovahs
Since the goal of Zksync is to be equivalent to L1 in terms of dev experience. Specification inconsistencies are considered low severity or Med?


[03/12/2023 13:12] vladbochok
If you mean EVM/Ethereum specification, then it depends in discrepancy, if there is a real significant impact for the existed protocols, it may be even high-severity issue. Please note, we are not bytecode equivalent also the gas model is different, so some differences are quite expected.

{Reactions}
💯 

[03/12/2023 13:13] vladbochok
In case you mean our specification, idk, most likely low/QA, but again depends on the impact.

function getCallFlags() internal view returns (uint256 callFlags) {
        address callAddr = CALLFLAGS_CALL_ADDRESS;
        assembly {
            callFlags := staticcall(0, callAddr, 0, 0xFFFF, 0, 0)
        }
    }
```

Do we have the callflags_call_address source code?

{Reactions}

[03/13/2023 07:19] barichek
That is not a smart contract.

I believe that compiler just replaces such specific call with zkEVM special opcode to get the callFlags.


[03/13/2023 07:32] supernovahs
So it's compiler's duty to check if the call is system call or not ?


[03/13/2023 07:32] supernovahs
Because it will pass the 2-bit

That is not a "system call". It's just a way to tell the compiler that a particular special one zkEVM opcode should be used.

how do you know it? why 22?


[03/14/2023 14:31] benderml.
Did you run the quickstart command before doing `yarn test`? This error happens because your `yarn` is trying to get `solc` from github (which I should have noticed since you are downloading `list.json`), but it has been deprecated over 3 years ago. I could imagine this happens because of an old `yarn` or `npm` version that still looks for `solc` on github. Could you post `yarn --version` and `npm --version` output?


[03/14/2023 14:31] supernovahs
yarn version 1.22.19
npm version 8.15.0


[03/14/2023 14:33] benderml.
OK, this npm is over 4 years old, the latest is 19. We are aware that many distros bring in an extremely outdated npm version via default package manager (e.g. Ubuntu), but this will not work. Please update your `npm` to at least 16 or later and give it a try again.

this is really helpful, thanks. I'm still not exactly sure of how I can test things like calldata pointers, or the stuff in L1Messenger.sol . Can I just import things like `EfficientCall.sol` in a test and it will manipulate pointers behind the scenes? And for L1Messenger, can I just interact with it by calling functions in the  `L1_MESSENGER_CONTRACT` address? I didn't see any tests that import the system contracts or their interfaces so that's why I'm asking. cc: @Vlad B | zkSync

We design the VM to `call`/`staticcall`/`delegatecall`/`mimiccall` to be as zk-friendly as possible, it improves the performance and makes audits easier. So we exclude the `msg.value` from there and found a way to integrate it as a system contract (see `MsgValueSimulator`/`L2EthToken`)

It could, first use-case on the top of my head is the force send ETH. I think that it's one of the libraries of OZ, or maybe in some kind of contract that does a "call" with x value to an address, and if that reverts, selfdestruct into it

I'm attempting to check the bootloader.yul file's code. I havent checked any messages here to see if same question was already posted, so forgive my ignorance.
Newbie here.

I cannot for the life of me get the bootloader.yul compiled, because it's littered with "errors"/placeholders/non-standard Yul code, undeclared variables, duplicate variables, and the list goes on.

So, I assume it's manual check only then (3200+ lines of code).👀

30 = 32 - 2, the `uint16` is 2 byte long
24 = 32 - 8, the `uint64` is 8 byte long

The idea is to get the offset where last X-bytes of the words is the expected payload data (`uint16`/`uint64`).


[03/18/2023 13:52] Franfran#5067
+ as the return type is uint16/uint64, it gets down-casted. It got me for some time, thought that the calldataload would load neighbour words from the byte array as well

any help for setting up the env ? Looks like it cannot find llvm, even if my version is 15.0.7.

```sh
error: No suitable version of LLVM was found system-wide or pointed
              to by LLVM_SYS_150_PREFIX.
       
              Consider using `llvmenv` to compile an appropriate copy of LLVM, and
              refer to the llvm-sys documentation for more information.

It seems that llvm was not built successfully. Are you using the quick-start command? Have you seen any errors during the build?


[03/18/2023 20:18] Franfran#5067
Yes, that's the only error I'm seeing


[03/18/2023 20:20] koolexc
Hey, I had the same error, I just installed LLVM independently


[03/18/2023 20:23] Franfran#5067
llvm clang right ?


[03/18/2023 20:23] Franfran#5067
its already installed on my machine


[03/18/2023 20:23] koolexc
Yes


[03/18/2023 20:24] koolexc
Try to re-install?


[03/18/2023 20:38] antond3
Are you sure that it was the same error? Because it looks like zkevm-llvm is not found


[03/18/2023 20:51] koolexc
On my machine yes


[03/18/2023 21:20] antond3
I see, maybe the error is gone because with clang llvm was installed some dependencies. Anyway @Franfran if the problem will be not fixed, could you please share the quick-start command output, especially the zkevm-llvm build(it will be so big, so you can pipe the output to the file)

Could someone clarify how ETH is transferred during contract deployment? How are the funds meant to get to `ContractDeployer` for it to transfer to the new contract?

[03/19/2023 08:45] vladbochok
User call the `create[2][Account]` with provided `msg.value`. The contract deployer set value for the next call and transfer the ether balance. After make a mimic call, to call the constructor on behalf of the `msg.sender`.


[03/19/2023 08:59] .ellar
Ty!


[03/19/2023 10:06] Franfran#5067
The contract at `GET_EXTRA_ABI_DATA_ADDRESS` is out of scope right ?


[03/19/2023 10:39] Franfran#5067
Sorry for not pinging you @AntonD this was the output of the quick-start command


[03/19/2023 10:55] vladbochok
There is no contract on `GET_EXTRA_ABI_DATA_ADDRESS`, it is compiler simulation. Please read the https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/tree/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64#simulations-via-our-compiler

if a contract contains something like: `anotherContract.foo{value: msg.value}()` I suppose the compiler will put a call to MsgValueSimulator inbetween?
